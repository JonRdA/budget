# BUDGET
Expense tracking, classification and report automation.

# TODO
[ ] Pass nonessential to 'buy' cat.
[ ] Complete reporting predefined options.
[ ] Set daily usage functions.
[ ] Change cats with rules.

## REPORTING
[ ] Expense breakdown. For any month or all. Pie chart.
[ ] Time series, for any cat/group, evolution. Barplot.
    * Between 2 specific dates (months).
    * Add barplot for any cat.
    * Barplot accepts 2 or more inputs.
    * Issue with selecting groups, databases.. 2 reports?


## TO IMPROVE
* Database.add_account() -> only check account VS Database, it will detect 2 
  duplicates in account, which should not.

## FILES
 * Transactions (individual account & database).
 * JSON -> cat/subcat, groups & predefined cats.
